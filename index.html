    <p>Python was conceived in the late 1980s by Guido van Rossum at Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) in the Netherlands as a successor to the ABC language (itself inspired by SETL), capable of exception handling and interfacing with the Amoeba operating system. Its implementation began in December 1989. Van Rossum continued as Python's lead developer until July 12, 2018, when he announced his "permanent vacation" from his responsibilities as Python's Benevolent Dictator For Life, a title the Python community bestowed upon him to reflect his long-term commitment as the project's chief decision-maker. In January, 2019, active Python core developers elected Brett Cannon, Nick Coghlan, Barry Warsaw, Carol Willing and Van Rossum to a five-member "Steering Council" to lead the project.</p>

<p>Python 2.0 was released on 16 October 2000 with many major new features, including a cycle-detecting garbage collector and support for Unicode.</p>

<p>Python 3.0 was released on 3 December 2008. It was a major revision of the language that is not completely backward-compatible. Many of its major features were backported to Python 2.6.x and 2.7.x version series. Releases of Python 3 include the 2to3 utility, which automates (at least partially) the translation of Python 2 code to Python 3.</p>

    <header>Features and philosophy</header>   
    <p>Python is a multi-paradigm programming language. Object-oriented programming and structured programming are fully supported, and many of its features support functional programming and aspect-oriented programming (including by metaprogramming and metaobjects (magic methods). Many other paradigms are supported via extensions, including design by contract and logic programming.</p>
      <p>The language's core philosophy is summarized in the document The Zen of Python (PEP 20), which includes aphorisms such as:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Beautiful is better than ugly</li>
        <li>Explicit is better than implicit</li>
        <li>Simple is better than complex</li>
        <li>Complex is better than complicated</li>
        <li>Readability counts</li>
      </ul>

    <section class="main-section" id="statements_and_control_flow">
    <header>Statements and control flow</header>   
    <p>Python's statements include (among others):</p>  
    <ul>  
    <li>The assignment statement (token '=', the equals sign). This operates differently than in traditional imperative programming languages, and this fundamental mechanism (including the nature of Python's version of variables) illuminates many other features of the language. Assignment in C, e.g., <code>x = 2</code>, translates to "typed variable name x receives a copy of numeric value 2". The (right-hand) value is copied into an allocated storage location for which the (left-hand) variable name is the symbolic address. The memory allocated to the variable is large enough (potentially quite large) for the declared type. In the simplest case of Python assignment, using the same example, <code>x = 2</code>, translates to "(generic) name x receives a reference to a separate, dynamically allocated object of numeric (int) type of value 2." This is termed binding the name to the object. Since the name's storage location doesn't contain the indicated value, it is improper to call it a variable. Names may be subsequently rebound at any time to objects of greatly varying types, including strings, procedures, complex objects with data and methods, etc. Successive assignments of a common value to multiple names, e.g., <code>x = 2</code>; <code>y = 2</code>; <code>z = 2</code> result in allocating storage to (at most) three names and one numeric object, to which all three names are bound. Since a name is a generic reference holder it is unreasonable to associate a fixed data type with it. However at a given time a name will be bound to some object, which will have a type; thus there is dynamic typing.</li>
    <li>The <code>if</code> statement, which conditionally executes a block of code, along with <code>else</code> and <code>elif</code> (a contraction of else-if).</li>
    <li>The <code>for</code> statement, which iterates over an iterable object, capturing each element to a local variable for use by the attached block.</li>
    <li>The <code>while</code> statement, which executes a block of code as long as its condition is true.</li>
    <li>The <code>try</code> statement, which allows exceptions raised in its attached code block to be caught and handled by except clauses; it also ensures that clean-up code in a <code>finally</code> block will always be run regardless of how the block exits.</li>
    <li>The <code>raise</code> statement, used to raise a specified exception or re-raise a caught exception.</li>
    <li>The <code>class</code> statement, which executes a block of code and attaches its local namespace to a class, for use in object-oriented programming.</li>
    <li>The <code>def</code> statement, which defines a function or method.</li>
    <li>The <code>with</code> statement, from Python 2.5 released on September 2006, which encloses a code block within a context manager (for example, acquiring a lock before the block of code is run and releasing the lock afterwards, or opening a file and then closing it), allowing Resource Acquisition Is Initialization (RAII)-like behavior and replaces a common try/finally idiom.</li>
    <li>The <code>pass</code> statement, which serves as a NOP. It is syntactically needed to create an empty code block.</li>
    <li>The <code>assert</code> statement, used during debugging to check for conditions that ought to apply.</li>
    <li>The <code>yield</code> statement, which returns a value from a generator function. From Python 2.5, <code>yield</code> is also an operator. This form is used to implement coroutines.</li>
    <li>The <code>import</code> statement, which is used to import modules whose functions or variables can be used in the current program. There are three ways of using import: <code>import &#60;module name&#62; [as &#60;alias&#62;] </code> or <code>from &#60;module name&#62; import *</code> or <code>from &#60;module name&#62; import &#60;definition 1&#62; [as &#60;alias 1&#62;], &#60;definition 2&#62; [as &#60;alias 2&#62;], ...</code>.</li>
    <li>The <code>print</code> statement was changed to the <code>print()</code> function in Python 3.</li>  
    </ul> 
    <p>Python does not support tail call optimization or first-class continuations, and, according to Guido van Rossum, it never will. However, better support for coroutine-like functionality is provided in 2.5, by extending Python's generators. Before 2.5, generators were lazy iterators; information was passed unidirectionally out of the generator. From Python 2.5, it is possible to pass information back into a generator function, and from Python 3.3, the information can be passed through multiple stack levels.</p>

    <section class="main-section" id="expressions">
    <header>Expressions</header>   
    <p>Some Python expressions are similar to languages such as C and Java, while some are not:</p> 
    <ul> 
    <li>Addition, subtraction, and multiplication are the same, but the behavior of division differs. There are two types of divisions in Python. They are floor division <code>//</code> and integer <code>/</code>division. Python also added the <code>**</code> operator for exponentiation.</li> 
    <li>From Python 3.5, the new <code>@</code> infix operator was introduced. It is intended to be used by libraries such as NumPy for matrix multiplication.</li>
    <li>In Python, <code>==</code> compares by value, versus Java, which compares numerics by value and objects by reference. (Value comparisons in Java on objects can be performed with the <code>equals()</code> method.) Python's <code>is</code> operator may be used to compare object identities (comparison by reference). In Python, comparisons may be chained, for example <code>a &#60;= b &#60;= c.</code></li> 
    <li>Python uses the words <code>and</code>, <code>or</code>, <code>not</code> for its boolean operators rather than the symbolic <code>&&</code>, <code>||</code>, <code>!</code> used in Java and C.</li> 
    <li>Python has a type of expression termed a list comprehension. Python 2.4 extended list comprehensions into a more general expression termed a generator expression.</li>
    <li>Anonymous functions are implemented using lambda expressions; however, these are limited in that the body can only be one expression.</li> 
    <li>Conditional expressions in Python are written as <code>x if c else y</code> (different in order of operands from the <code>c ? x : y</code> operator common to many other languages).</li>
    <li>Python makes a distinction between lists and tuples. Lists are written as <code>[1, 2, 3]</code>, are mutable, and cannot be used as the keys of dictionaries (dictionary keys must be immutable in Python). Tuples are written as <code>(1, 2, 3)</code>, are immutable and thus can be used as the keys of dictionaries, provided all elements of the tuple are immutable. The <code>+</code> operator can be used to concatenate two tuples, which does not directly modify their contents, but rather produces a new tuple containing the elements of both provided tuples. Thus, given the variable <code>t</code> initially equal to <code>(1, 2, 3)</code>, executing <code>t = t + (4, 5)</code> first evaluates <code>t + (4, 5)</code>, which yields <code>(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)</code>, which is then assigned back to <code>t</code>, thereby effectively "modifying the contents" of <code>t</code>, while conforming to the immutable nature of tuple objects. Parentheses are optional for tuples in unambiguous contexts.</li> 
    <li>Python features sequence unpacking where multiple expressions, each evaluating to anything that can be assigned to (a variable, a writable property, etc.), are associated in the identical manner to that forming tuple literals and, as a whole, are put on the left hand side of the equal sign in an assignment statement. The statement expects an iterable object on the right hand side of the equal sign that produces the same number of values as the provided writable expressions when iterated through, and will iterate through it, assigning each of the produced values to the corresponding expression on the left.</li> 
    <li>Python has a "string format" operator <code>%</code>. This functions analogous to <code>printf</code> format strings in C, e.g. <code>"spam=%s eggs=%d" % ("blah", 2)</code> evaluates to <code>"spam=blah eggs=2"</code>. In Python 3 and 2.6+, this was supplemented by the <code>format()</code> method of the <code>str</code> class, e.g. <code>"spam={0} eggs={1}".format("blah", 2)</code>. Python 3.6 added "f-strings": <code>blah = "blah"; eggs = 2; f'spam={blah} eggs={eggs}'</code></li>
    <li>Python has various kinds of string literals:<ul>
    <li>Strings delimited by single or double quote marks. Unlike in Unix shells, Perl and Perl-influenced languages, single quote marks and double quote marks function identically. Both kinds of string use the backslash <code>(\)</code> as an escape character. String interpolation became available in Python 3.6 as "formatted string literals".</li>
    <li>Triple-quoted strings, which begin and end with a series of three single or double quote marks. They may span multiple lines and function like here documents in shells, Perl and Ruby.</li> 
    <li>Raw string varieties, denoted by prefixing the string literal with an <code>r</code> . Escape sequences are not interpreted; hence raw strings are useful where literal backslashes are common, such as regular expressions and Windows-style paths. Compare "<code>@</code>-quoting" in C#.</li>

    </ul>  
    </li> 
    <li>Python has array index and array slicing expressions on lists, denoted as <code>a[key]</code>, <code>a[start:stop]</code> or <code>a[start:stop:step]</code>. Indexes are zero-based, and negative indexes are relative to the end. Slices take elements from the start index up to, but not including, the stop index. The third slice parameter, called step or stride, allows elements to be skipped and reversed. Slice indexes may be omitted, for example <code>a[:]</code> returns a copy of the entire list. Each element of a slice is a shallow copy.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Most Python implementations (including CPython) include a read–eval–print loop (REPL), permitting them to function as a command line interpreter for which the user enters statements sequentially and receives results immediately.</p>

<p>Other shells, including IDLE and IPython, add further abilities such as auto-completion, session state retention and syntax highlighting.</p>

<p>As well as standard desktop integrated development environments, there are Web browser-based IDEs; SageMath (intended for developing science and math-related Python programs); PythonAnywhere, a browser-based IDE and hosting environment; and Canopy IDE, a commercial Python IDE emphasizing scientific computing.</p>

    <p>Since 2003, Python has consistently ranked in the top ten most popular programming languages in the TIOBE Programming Community Index where, as of December 2018, it is the third most popular language (behind Java, and C). It was selected Programming Language of the Year in 2007, 2010, and 2018.</p>

<p>An empirical study found that scripting languages, such as Python, are more productive than conventional languages, such as C and Java, for programming problems involving string manipulation and search in a dictionary, and determined that memory consumption was often "better than Java and not much worse than C or C++".</p>

<p>Large organizations that use Python include Wikipedia, Google, Yahoo!,CERN, NASA, Facebook, Amazon, Instagram, Spotify and some smaller entities like ILM and ITA. The social news networking site Reddit is written entirely in Python.</p>

<p>Python can serve as a scripting language for web applications, e.g., via mod_wsgi for the Apache web server.With Web Server Gateway Interface, a standard API has evolved to facilitate these applications. Web frameworks like Django, Pylons, Pyramid, TurboGears, web2py, Tornado, Flask, Bottle and Zope support developers in the design and maintenance of complex applications. Pyjs and IronPython can be used to develop the client-side of Ajax-based applications. SQLAlchemy can be used as data mapper to a relational database. Twisted is a framework to program communications between computers, and is used (for example) by Dropbox.</p>

<p>Libraries such as NumPy, SciPy and Matplotlib allow the effective use of Python in scientific computing, with specialized libraries such as Biopython and Astropy providing domain-specific functionality. SageMath is a mathematical software with a notebook interface programmable in Python: its library covers many aspects of mathematics, including algebra, combinatorics, numerical mathematics, number theory, and calculus.</p>

<p>Python has been successfully embedded in many software products as a scripting language, including in finite element method software such as Abaqus, 3D parametric modeler like FreeCAD, 3D animation packages such as 3ds Max, Blender, Cinema 4D, Lightwave, Houdini, Maya, modo, MotionBuilder, Softimage, the visual effects compositor Nuke, 2D imaging programs like GIMP, Inkscape, Scribus and Paint Shop Pro, and musical notation programs like scorewriter and capella. GNU Debugger uses Python as a pretty printer to show complex structures such as C++ containers. Esri promotes Python as the best choice for writing scripts in ArcGIS. It has also been used in several video games, and has been adopted as first of the three available programming languages in Google App Engine, the other two being Java and Go.</p>

<p>Python is commonly used in artificial intelligence projects with the help of libraries like TensorFlow, Keras and Scikit-learn. As a scripting language with modular architecture, simple syntax and rich text processing tools, Python is often used for natural language processing.</p>

<p>Many operating systems include Python as a standard component. It ships with most Linux distributions, AmigaOS 4, FreeBSD (as a package), NetBSD, OpenBSD (as a package) and macOS and can be used from the command line (terminal). Many Linux distributions use installers written in Python: Ubuntu uses the Ubiquity installer, while Red Hat Linux and Fedora use the Anaconda installer. Gentoo Linux uses Python in its package management system, Portage.</p>

<p>Python is used extensively in the information security industry, including in exploit development.</p>

<p>Most of the Sugar software for the One Laptop per Child XO, now developed at Sugar Labs, is written in Python. The Raspberry Pi single-board computer project has adopted Python as its main user-programming language. </p>

<p>LibreOffice includes Python, and intends to replace Java with Python. Its Python Scripting Provider is a core feature[157] since Version 4.0 from 7 February 2013.</p>
